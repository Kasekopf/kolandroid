USE THE APP AT YOUR OWN RISK. Although I have fixed any bugs I've encountered the app is still DEFINITELY in the beta phase.

The app requires android 4.0.3. Since this app is not yet available for the Google Play Store, you will also have to enable app sideloading on your device. To do this, go to Settings->Security and check the box labeled "Unknown Sources".

## Problems installing the app?
* If you get a Parse Error when installing the .apk, first check that your android version is 4.0.3 or above.
* Next, verify that the .apk file you downloaded is around 6-7MB in size. If it is smaller, the downloader you used to download the .apk may have downloaded a corrupted file. Try using a different downloader, or downloading the .apk on your computer and transfering it to your phone.
* If these don't solve your problem, I would love to hear about it! You can kmail me in KoL as Kasekopf or email me at kingdomofloathingandroid@gmail.com. Please include your android version and the type of phone you are using.

## Problems using the app?
* If the app crashes, the next startup should automatically trigger error reporting. You will be able to send a description and error log directly to me.
* If the app has non-fatal issues, these are not automatically reported. Feel free to kmail me as Kasekopf or email me at kingdomofloathingandroid@gmail.com.

## Have an opinion about the app? Want to see new features?
